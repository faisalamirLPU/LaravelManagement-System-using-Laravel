## Getting started

- clone the project `git clone https://github.com/avinashseth/ckerp-system.git ckerp-system`
- install the dependencies `composer install`
- install the migrations by running `php artisan migrate`

## Branching strategy
- Never commit your code to `main` branch
- always create a branch with your name and push only that branch
- if you need to add new feature, add a local branch and merge that branch to your name and then push
